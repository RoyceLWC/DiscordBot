:round_pushpin: TEAM/DRIVERS BASHING:
► Do not bash, attack or insult a driver, a team or their fanbases. A joke is a joke, and a meme is a meme, but that is not a good excuse to exhibit toxic tendencies.
:round_pushpin: NEGATIVITY:
► Do not wish for misfortunes of any kind on a driver, team or fanbase. Excessive negativity will not be tolerated; if you don’t like something, simply refrain from commenting (or watching!)
:round_pushpin: FANWARS:
► Do not pit users, servers and other communities against each other. If you came to this server to troll Charles’ or Ferrari fans, you are, quite simply, in the wrong place.
:round_pushpin: RESPECT THE DRIVERS’ PRIVACY:
► We all love our tea, but this is not the place for gossip. Do not speculate about a driver’s private life or actions, and refrain from making comments about it. On this note, please refrain from posting fanfiction or other fan edits which might be potentially awkward for all parties involved.
:round_pushpin: SENSITIVE TOPICS/CONTENT:
► Do not post images, videos or sensitive content about fatal crashes. Please respect the drivers, their families and everyone else involved. Do not speculate about these tragic events, and always be respectful when talking about it on the server.
